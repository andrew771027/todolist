# TO DO List
#### Video Demo:  [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/os1wc77o5brb7od/CS50-Final%20Project.mov?dl=0)
#### Description:

I used a python based flask framework and build a simple web application which is "To Do List". Since I didn't quite familiar with javascript, I didn't use much more technique for FE. </br>
In app.py, there are three routers, home, delete and update which provide user to create, read, update, delete the item. </br>
In templates folder, there are the html files, base.html, index.html and update.html. Both index.html, update.html are inherent from base.html.</br>
One of special is that, this is my first time to deploy the app to the cloud platform, Heroku. not use localhost anymore. </br>
